# FDTD Electromagnetic Resonant Cavity Simulator

In this repository, you will find a mini framework developed using the FDTD method to solve Maxwell's equations and simulate electromagnetic wave propagation in two-dimensional resonant cavities.

## Usage
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python3 main.py
```

The [main.py](/main.py) has an example code to simulations available in [the section below](#some-results)
